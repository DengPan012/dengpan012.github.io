**‘Social decision-making research is like playing games!’** I said excitedly one night, after sitting four hours in my chair analyzing data.
As a biology major at Peking University, I accidentally walked into a classroom teaching *Game Theory*. I was fascinated by how simple mathematics can capture our complex behaviors. After taking this course, I realized that besides the ‘biological nature,’ I also cared about the ‘social nature’ of human beings. I started to wonder: **What are the neural mechanisms underlying our social decisions?**
